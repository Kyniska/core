Core: A Version of Democracy
====

"In this constitution of the Five Nations are found practically all of the safeguards which have been raised in historic parliments to protect home affairs from centralized authority." - Arthur Pound, Johnson of the Mohawks

Core aims to translate the organizing principles (laws) from the Constitution of the now 6 Nations (or Haudenosaunee) to operational form using Blockchain technology.

# Some defining differences:

- Unity elevates proposals (No leader or law accepted without unanimous consent of the people (mostly true))
- The people retain accountability
- Eldest women select candidates for leadership and have ability to remove
- Good leaders hold position for life
- Democracy is materiarchal

# Validity

Some may question the authenticity and validity of the sources and claims relating to this effort.  

While we have come to our own conclusions, for our own reasons, we invite all to consider not the validity of the sources or claims, but the principles proposed and their organization.  How likely is this proposal to work, to support and nourish any group of people seeking organizing principles for governance that satisfy and unify? 

# Why only psuedo-code (for now)?

Wishing to honor the purity of the original blockchain network (supporting Bitcoin) the hope was to use the Ethereum network.  However, the Solidity programming language does not afford types of privacy vital to this democratic structure – especially relating to accountability:

“Everything that is inside a contract is visible to all external observers. Making something private only prevents other contracts from accessing and modifying the information, but it will still be visible to the whole world outside of the blockchain.”

https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#visibility-and-getters

For preserving, or returning to, equilibrium among members, certain types of accountability require feedback between individuals involved to remain private.  
Thus, for the moment, as alternatives like Hyperledger’s Fabric project continue to evolve, the aim is to define the framework and instructions for any language, until a natural fit becomes clear.

- Potentials: Komodo and Fabric

# Translating to code

Reading so far suggests bloodlines/skin color/native language did not take precedence for acceptance (reference needed).  Any individual agreeing to follow the agreed-to laws was accepted into the community.  One challenge, this policy was applied in a context were face-to-face interaction was available - and thus able to authenticate and provide accountability.  Online, false identities are not only possible but widely used.  If accountability plays a vital role in this governmental structure, how to verify the authenticity of any address for inclusion? 

Privacy needs: addresses assigned to roles have permissions to view strings; relating to loyalities and the potential for factions to emerge, if members are assigned to more than one group (as a preventative mechanism, members can only see members of their group? separate arrays for separate groups?)

Data-types in use:

Addresses: representing presence and identity of individuals and perhaps groups

Strings: representing dominant loyalties of individuals (bloodline, country-of-origin, native language, etc), feedback for accountability (leader is guilty of...)

Bools: 
- receipt of feedback
- presence of witness during sharing of feedback
- agreement to align with principles for organizing behavior (laws)

Arrays: holding members of groups and characteristics referencing loyalities sequenced by dominance.

# Membership Qualifications (Bool)

* how to verify address connects to a person who can be held accountable remains an unknown *

- No religion as modern civilization defined it acknowledged
- All skins colors accepted.  Heritage does not disqualify
- Agreement that personal behavior will honor (align with) organizing principles (laws) accepted by community 

# Loyalties to consider for group placement (Strings)

- family-of-origin
- place-of-origin
- Native language
- additional influences likely to fuel feelings of guilt or innocence (an ex-lover or murdered parent)

# Composition

- Each member of the Six Nations belonged to two constellations as a preventative against rivalries
- We recognize the rivalries that presently exist, whether emerging in this life or inherited from the past, will not likely be unraveled  

# Voting procedure (Addresses / Bools / Strings)

- constellations of loyalties: all proposals for new laws or leaders must receive unified agreement from each constellation network
- all members of circle must accept for proposal to move forward
- arrays of addresses: addresses / string (proposed law or name of selected)
- all agree: boolean
- proposal forwarded to next circle
- dissent: boolean / string
- if dissent occurs, opportunity for refinement/revision available
- perspective provided (why it is not accepted, what change is requested/prefered or no modification is possible) (String)
- proposal returned to originating circle (string from one address to another)
- originating circle can ask for clarification

# Accountability (Addresses / Strings / Bools)

- For primary and secondary leaders:
- Complaints from any citizen relating to the chosen leader are received by the Grandmother who nominated the leader
- Three opportunities are provided for the Grandmother to share the complaint with the leader, and for the leader to adjust his behavior to re-align with law.
- For each opportunity, a different, specified witness will witness.
- Should the three opportunities fail, the Grandmother holds responsibility for removing the title from the man.

# Transaction costs (Addresses)

- Community fund for addresses to pull from?
